### Past

I was born in Zagreb in 1988. I received my Masters degree in 2014 from University in Zagreb from Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computing ([FER](https://www.fer.unizg.hr)). My research during the study was focused on fiber optic technology. From January 2015 till January 2019 I worked as a research assistant in [Applied optics laboratory(AOLab)](https://aolab.fer.hr) of the Department of Wireless Communications(ZRK) on few science projects involving fiber optic communications and sensor systems.

I graduated in October 2018 with PhD thesis titled "Optical communication based on wavelength reuse and modulation averaging" with Summa Cum Laude, under the supervision of prof. [Dubravko Babić](https://aolab.fer.hr/aolab/people/dubravko_babic).

I am also an originator of the project [CROSPERITY](https://www.fer.unizg.hr/zkist/FERSAT/pocetak), alongside [Dario Bojanjac](https://www.fer.unizg.hr/zkist/djelatnici/dario_bojanjac) and [Josip Lončar](https://www.fer.unizg.hr/zkist/djelatnici/josip_loncar).

From January 2019 till September 2020 I was enrolled as PostDoc in the Department of Electronic Systems and Information Processing(ZESOI), where I was researching photonic signal processing, optical RF filters and other photonic technologies.
