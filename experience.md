### Microscopy
* microscope theory and principle of operation: widefield, phase contrast, darkfield, confocal, two-photon, super-resolution (SIM, SMLM, STED)
* hands on experience in confocal and STED


### Lasers and optics
* principle of laser operation (gas, FL-LD, vcsel, dfb, dbr, fiber laser, etc.)
* injection-locking of multimode sources to a single wavelength by self-tuning in an expanded resonant cavity or external source
* tuning an injection-locked source to an unknown excitation wavelength by diode temperature or current - patents
* mode locking - creating a pulsed laser
* fiber optic technology - communications and sensors
* noise of incoherent sources (ASE, WCFP-LD, RSOAâ€¦)
* RF photodetector noise
* light modulation by direct source modulation or external modulator (intensity, absorption)
* intensity modulation suppression methods (optical ring, saturated amplification of optical amplifiers, current saturation FP-LD)
* laser spectrum measurements - homodyne and heterodyne methods
* optical sensor systems - FBG fiber, Sagnac interferometer, fiber as a sensor
* fiber optical rings - suppression of modulations and as optical filters
* light polarization: measurement, S-parameters, light depolarization
* photonic signal processing - IIR / FIR optical filters
